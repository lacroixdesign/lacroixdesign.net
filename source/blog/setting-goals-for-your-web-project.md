Every great design project begins with clear goals. In a recent post, we wrote about why we ask our clients, "[What Does Success Look Like?](/blog/what-does-success-look-like/)" Setting concrete goals for a project makes way for successful outcomes. It also creates a path to measure how design adds value to your business.

Start by asking yourself: "Why do I need a website?" or "Why do I need a new one?" If your answers are that the current one is old or looks dated, that is a start. However, there are probably deeper reasons. Most likely, you are wanting a website that is more effective, or one that can help you grow your businesses and generate more income. Your next website should be an tool to help your business flourish.

If you are having a difficult time assessing your goals, contact a designer and work with them to help you determine them. Designers are wired to spot opportunities that aren't revealed through traditional analytical thinking. Additionally, they work with businesses on a regular basis and some designers might even be running their own business. Therefore, they make great consultants and can often help you to envision and achieve goals for growing your company - large or small.

Our most successful projects have come from briefs that had business goals rather than aesthetic goals. Many of these goals began with questions like, "How can we …" rather than simple requests. In these cases, we have been able to successfully help our clients accomplish goals, such as getting more visitors, keeping them coming back, improving social media interactions, making the experience more personal and many others. If the client had just requested a site instead of looking to solve business goals, these would have never been accomplished.

**Here are some questions that you can ask to set goals for your next web design project.**

- Why do you want a website built?
- Why is your current website not working?
- If this is not built, how will it affect your business financially?
- If successful, how will it affect your business positively?
- If you were to hire someone to do the job of your website, what would be their job description?
- Did you do any research to determine that this project was necessary?
- What will determine the success of this project and when will that be evaluated?
