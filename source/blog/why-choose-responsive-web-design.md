A little over a year ago, we designed our first responsive website. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Responsive web design</a> was something that we had been following for awhile but had yet to try on our own. We had both recently read <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com" target="_blank">Ethan Marcotte's</a> <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">wonderful book</a> and were in the midst of designing materials for <a href="http://nashville.aiga.org" target="_blank">AIGA Nashville's</a> 2012 Student Design Conference, Dish. It just so happened that on this Saturday afternoon, we decided that we were going to take a crack at it and complete the project in a day. It took all night &mdash and several bottles of sake &mdash to complete and as the sun came up, we had our first, albeit very basic, responsive site.

We haven't turned back since. Every site that we have designed and developed since then has utilized responsive web design to deliver content appropriately across a vast range of devices. As time went on, our responsive sites improved and so did our process for creating them. No longer fixated on exact pixels sizes, we embraced the dynamic fluidity of the web more and more. With each new site, we used analytics to test our theories and were able to examine how users were interacting with the products that we had created using various devices. We were able to help our clients engage more users at a deeper level.

Recently, <a href="http://www.lukew.com" target="_blank">Luke Wroblewski</a> wrote a fantastic blog post, titled <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1691" target="_blank">Data Monday: Impact of Responsive Designs</a>. In the post, he gathered the data reported by four sources who have publicly released statistics on the outcome of their responsive websites.

Although it is only four sources, the numbers reveal the benefits that come as a result of a responsive redesign. We have witnessed similar engagement on higher traffic sites that we have had the opportunity to work on, such as [The 5 Love Languages®](/case-studies/the-5-love-languages/) and [Melanie Joye LMT](/case-studies/melanie-joye-lmt/). Our goal is to help our clients grow their business. This often includes increasing visitors, retaining visitors, engaging visitors, creating conversions and ultimately creating more revenue. Our experience with responsive web design up to this point has proven to be successful in achieving these goals.

Alas, we do realize the responsive web design will not be the best solution in every case and that in some circumstances it may be unnecessary. However, we currently find it to be a great solution for many of the clients that we serve. With every client and with every project, we seek to provide the most future friendly solution possible. By creating sites that adapt to viewport size to best showcase the content, we are providing our clients with a solution that delivers a great experience on the devices that exist today as well as those that are still yet to be released.
