There’s always been the excitement when something Michael and I have made is released to the world. That moment is fleeting once we begin to dissect every minute detail in search of opportunities for improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritique is important and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Although, this was quite problematic when I began my career as a print designer and everything that I designed was more permanent. As a web and product designer, I delight in the flexible and iterative qualities of the medium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the business of client services, you do not always get the opportunity to continually improve upon everything that you ship. Very often, the client is happy, the project ends, you get paid and the thing that you created goes on without you. Sadly, these projects miss out on the beneficial iterations that happen after your have been able to assess how the visitors or users interact with the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, we have had the pleasure to work with a number of clients who allow us to return to previous projects and tackle new challenges. I’m consistently assured that these experiences will continue to improve if we never treat them as finished. Nowhere is this more evident than in our personal projects. For example, our own website is never finished and we are constantly trying to improve the our visitors\u0026#39; experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNearly a year ago, I wrote a \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/doing-more-with-less/\"\u003epost for the launch of our new website\u003c/a\u003e about how a simpler solution provides us with the freedom to iterate. Our current website utilizes \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://middlemanapp.com/\"\u003eMiddleman\u003c/a\u003e to generate a static site upon deployment and this provides a fantastic venue for exploring and implementing new solutions. Earlier this year, we made some improvements to our website. In this post, I’d like to share the decision making behind these changes and the results that we’ve received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Homepage Welcome Section\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, no other place on the site has received more copy revisions than the first section of our homepage. When you tackle a wide variety of design problems with a range of  solutions and tools, describing your business in one sentence is far from easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in a long time, I feel pretty good about what we have on there now. We love to design solutions that establish a connection and allow our clients to engage the audience in a very human way. We decided this copy needed more emphasis, so we adjusted the typography accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"The image background to the welcome section of our site was replaced with video, and typographic updates were made as well.\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/hero-comparison-89373e60.gif\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur previous background for this section was my desk. I believe that we have a nice workspace and I do tend to keep a tidy desk. However, this was far from being a compelling image for the homepage. We explored a number of solutions for this that included illustrations, solid colors, SVG animation and we eventually decided to use video. We love the personal proximity with which people use mobile devices and found that this created a visual connection to what we value. We also explored various methods of tinting the video to match our pink brand color, but we will cover that in a future post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFeatured Work \u0026amp; Services Section\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother area of our site we were never content with was the featured work section of the homepage. For a while, Michael and I were pretty set on trying to contain these in an interesting shape. After exhausting nearly every option we could think of, we eventually determined it was not the best solution and opted to go with a layout that is more consistent with the case studies on our site. In the end, this provides visitors with a more cohesive experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Featured Work and Services Section Comparison\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/featured-comparison-770a724b.jpg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOur previous Featured Work and Services sections \u003cem\u003e(left)\u003c/em\u003e compared to the updated design \u003cem\u003e(right)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, we also used an angled container for our services section. On a micro level, we enjoyed this concept, but it did not quite fit with everything else on our website. We determined that our previous image of my workspace might be appropriate in this space. It connects to the collection of tools and devices that we use solve our clients problems. We also made some typography changes to the headers in both of these sections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eImproving Visitor Engagement on Blogs \u0026amp; Case Studies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlog posts drive a lot of traffic to our site and this has made writing them a much more enjoyable process. Plus, the increased traffic makes examining the analytics more interesting. We found that many visitors were spending time on the site to read the entire post, but were bouncing off of the page once they finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Blog Recomendations\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"698\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/blog-recommendations-a51353b1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBlog posts and individual case studies now featured recommendations to facilitate exploration.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThus, we decided to implement a solution that encourages visitors to explore more content. Each post now concludes with a call to action followed by previews for three other posts. We also decided to add a similar experience to the individual case studies pages. The result? We are now seeing visitors land on individual blog or case study and diving deeper into the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eKeeping the Conversation Going\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince our website is deployed as a static build, commenting functionality is not a feature of our blog, nor do we really desire to manage comments. However, we do want to keep the conversation going, and Michael and I want to be available for any questions or responses. For this reason, we built a Twitter intent option into our post structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Blog Post Conversation Actions\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"1520\" height=\"288\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/conversation-actions-bfa533d5.png\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eReaders of our blog posts can now engage in the conversation on Twitter or Designer News.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have also found that some of our blog posts garner a lot of readers from \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.layervault.com/\"\u003eDesigner News\u003c/a\u003e. As a result, we decided to add a posting option so that our readers can continue the conversation through comments on Designer News.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIncreasing Email Newsletter Signup\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn August of last year, we added a subtle newsletter call to action to the footer of our site. Although we began to see subscribers trickle in, this was in no way a successful solution. Therefore, we decided to redesign this call to action to give it more visual weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Previous Call-To-Action\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/previous-newsletter-signup-de44013e.jpg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOur previous newsletter signup call-to-action.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"New Call-To-Action\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/new-newsletter-signup-6d55fff8.jpg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOur new, more prominent newsletter signup call-to-action.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more prominent call to action has more than doubled our list, and we are regularly adding new subscribers. This, in turn, leads to a new challenge of keeping up with our monthly delivery. Due to a busy workload, we have been a bit lax over the past several months, but we plan to pick back up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWe’re Still Far from Finished\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMichael and I have an ongoing \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://trello.com/jameslacroix/recommend\"\u003eTrello\u003c/a\u003e board where we regularly add new ideas and discuss solutions for improving our website. In doing so, we are also gaining clients who learn to value the process and set aside budgets for continual improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/far-from-finished/hurdle-3aaaeaa6.jpg"},{"id":"/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/","title":"Streamlining Our Proposal Writing Process","description":"How we are using Git, Markdown, CSS and Marked to create proposals more quickly.","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/","path":"/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/","published":"2015-03-13T11:50:00-05:00","updated":"2015-04-27T17:08:23-05:00","author":{"name":"James LaCroix","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/team/james-lacroix/","path":"/team/james-lacroix/","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/team/james-lacroix-bd5b0b76.jpg"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eAs designers and developers, it is our innate desire to spend time making things. Nevertheless, when you are running your own business, there are many other responsibilities required before, during and after a project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of these essential duties is writing proposals. After nearly 10 years of running LaCroix Design Co., the role of proposal writer is still one of my least favorites. A great deal of thought and effort goes into every proposal we send out. As a result, many hours are typically spent compiling notes from meetings and phone calls into a well-formulated document that not only proposes the most optimal solution, but also outlines the best process for arriving at that solution. Needless to say, it can be quite disheartening when a proposal is rejected or not even considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/angry-8290071a.gif\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProposals, however, serve a crucial role in the relationship between the client and designer. It defines scope, boundaries, expectations and, of course, payment. As a result, writing proposals is a task that cannot be avoided. In our studio, we are always seeking to optimize processes for a more efficient workflow in every business aspect. Therefore, we have sought to develop a proposal writing process that is more streamlined. Although we may continue to iterate on this process as time goes on, we have arrived at a solution using Git, Markdown and CSS that works very well for our small studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere We Started\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first began writing project proposals, the studio was mainly focused on providing print design and illustration services. Indesign was the obvious tool to create fantastic looking documents that were on-brand. Although it is poor practice, I often did all of my writing and editing in the application as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, it became beneficial to have a second set of eyes review each proposal. At this time, Michael had begun working with me on web projects and had zero familiarity with Indesign. We were both already using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\"\u003eMarkdown\u003c/a\u003e for taking notes, so it seemed like the obvious transition was to also use this for the drafting phase. We would take turns editing the Markdown file. Then, I would transfer all of the content block by block into the Indesign document. Although the Markdown syntax clearly delineated the different elements, this was still an arduous task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"480\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/faint-0d4e5868.gif\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also tried out \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bidsketch.com/\"\u003eBidsketch\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quoteroller.com/\"\u003eQuote Roller\u003c/a\u003e and  several other web applications designed at solving the proposal creation issue. While these are all fine pieces of software that provided some nice features, none of them really seemed to fit our needs. The editing process was still sluggish since content was separated into different admin sections and often the WYSIWYG editors caused more problems than they were worth. Every time we would abandon one of these tools, we would return to our Indesign process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOur Current Process with Git, Markdown \u0026amp; CSS\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately one year ago, we were approached by a number of prospective clients that required a fair amount of proposals to be delivered within a short amount of time. It was at this time that we finally decided we had to find a better process. We were already writing and editing our proposals in Markdown, so it only made sense that we should utilize the strengths of the syntax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we were already using Git for collaborating on website and software projects, using it for documents seemed like a sensible choice for this new process. Today, I begin by creating a draft of the proposal using Markdown — I prefer to use \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://writer.pro/\"\u003eIA Writer Pro\u003c/a\u003e for this and Michael prefers \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://atom.io/\"\u003eAtom\u003c/a\u003e — and commit it to a private \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e repository. We then have a \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://slack.com/r/024l00bf-02533q4k\"\u003eSlack\u003c/a\u003e notification set for any updates to this particular repo. Michael can then pull the document and provide any edits that he sees fit. We are able to continue this process until we have solidified the proposed solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the editing phase is completed, we use \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://marked2app.com/\"\u003eMarked 2\u003c/a\u003e to create a final document. One of Marked’s key features is the ability to style your content with a custom CSS style sheet. We slightly modified the \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/jamesdlacroix/d574d925c157114c2d7c\"\u003ebase stylesheet\u003c/a\u003e that came with the software to fit our brand’s proposal style. Additionally, with a snippet of HTML, we are able to create a cover page for each document that displays our logo using an SVG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-markup\"\u003e\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;cover\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n    \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;cover-logo\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n      \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;../assets/images/logo.svg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;LaCroix Design Co.\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\n    \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\n\n# Project Name\n### Client Company Name\n\n##### Prepared For: Client Name\n*13 March, 2015*\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarked offers a few key features that allow us to dynamically create some elements of the proposal. For example, a table of contents can be inserted anywhere in the document using the \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://marked2app.com/help/Special_Syntax.html\"\u003esoftware’s special syntax\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-markup\"\u003e\u0026lt;!--TOC--\u0026gt;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe same also applies to page breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-markup\"\u003e\u0026lt;!--BREAK--\u0026gt;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we are primarily automating page breaks through the apps settings by adding page breaks before every h1 and h2 element. Through the settings, we are a adding dynamically created headers and footers as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Marked Export Settings\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1665\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/marked-settings-02b0ae19.jpg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThese are the export settings that we are currently using to create our proposals.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we are ready to send over the proposal, we output it using the paginated PDF feature and quite often deliver it to the client using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hellosign.com?ref=92f9561f\u0026amp;s=S\"\u003eHelloSign\u003c/a\u003e.

We are now able to go straight from the editing process into a final proposal, and no longer have to copy and paste content into an Indesign file. Furthermore, many of our proposals are often read online and include links pointing toward recommended services. We are able to utilize the Markdown syntax to generate these links, which is far easier than applying them using Indesign’s interactive hyperlinks panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"480\" height=\"230\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/streamlining-our-proposal-writing-process/benefits-071202b5.gif\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdding visual elements to the proposal also became a lot easier. With Markdown, we are able to quickly add in figures with captions to help explain the solution or provide context to the scope of the project. As you will see in the example, we are creating tables in markdown for the project timeline. Timeline tables provide a great visual reference for our potential clients. Creating tables like these in design software would be much more time consuming, whereas our current solution allows for easy editing and implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFuture Enhancements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with nearly everything we work on, we are far from finished and are always looking to further iterate our solutions. We are eventually looking at breaking the reusable pieces of our proposals out into partials so that they can easily be inserted into a document. This would include basic contract definitions, intellectual property provisions, interactive provisions and basic elements such as a signature form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarked has a special syntax for \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://marked2app.com/help/Multi-File_Documents.html\"\u003emulti-file documents\u003c/a\u003e which would allow us to begin testing this process out. We have also contemplated creating a local build tool that would provide more customization for this process.

For example, if an entry started with the URL:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ehttp://example.com/first\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;but its slug was later changed to make it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ehttp://example.com/second\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;then visiting \u003ccode\u003e/first\u003c/code\u003e will redirect the user to \u003ccode\u003e/second\u003c/code\u003e. To do this, we developed a plugin which, on a request that is about to return a 404, will:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuery for the most recent revision with the same path prefix and that now defunct slug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFetch the current, live revision of that entry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRedirect (302) to that entry’s new URL.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing to note is that the query is intentionally isolated to the same prefix.

The first objective was to build a publishing platform that would include multiple sets of content types, with isolated author access to entries based on user permissions, the type of content and authorship. Additionally, the pieces of content needed a relational component in order to easily reference each other throughout the many facets of the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the initial requirements and the need to accommodate an array of future unidentified features, we immediately thought of using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buildwithcraft.com/\"\u003eCraft\u003c/a\u003e. We had used it previously for a handful of smaller projects and absolutely loved the entire experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Craft?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCraft is a CMS that works wonderfully with structured data, and it doesn’t make any unnecessary assumptions about how that data will be used on the front-end. It provides a head start by supplying the common features needed for a publishing platform such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser accounts and fine-grained permissions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContent entry with drafts and versioning\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn assortment of built-in field-types\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA robust query builder\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRouting \u0026amp; pagination\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, it has a powerful API to extend its functionality for your project’s specific needs which we’ll be discussing in future blog posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Publishing User Experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s important for us to enjoy building products with Craft, it’s even more important that our clients enjoy using the CMS. Thankfully, the client feedback from previous projects has been excellent. Navigating the CMS’ admin is simple and straightforward, while managing content is extremely easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA feature that was especially loved is the \u003cem\u003eLive Preview\u003c/em\u003e feature, which displays a side-by-side view of the content entry page and the actual output that visitors will see. This is notable because as content and data is entered, this feature of Craft will render the end result as the content changes. Here is Craft’s official promo video of it in action:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"video\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/111679726?title=0\u0026amp;amp;byline=0\u0026amp;amp;portrait=0\u0026amp;amp;color=f27390\u0026amp;amp;badge=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLive Preview in action.

The plan is to extract some of these from the project and open source them in the coming weeks. We’ll be following up with more blog posts when we do, as well as tips on Craft configuration and deployment.

Celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their best-selling album, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmhmm\"\u003eMMHMM\u003c/a\u003e, the tour was slated to be a special event for both the band and their fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to newly designed merchandise, the members of Relient K wanted to reprint classic merchandise from the timeframe of their original record release. This led me to an exploration of art files from 10 years back. Many of these files predated LaCroix Design Co. and I was amazed to find that I had retained so many of the design files and records from this time. We were successfully able to manufacture the classic apparel and the tour was a huge success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince starting LaCroix Design Co. in 2005, we have been victims of a burglary and numerous hard drive failures. The fact that I had retained a collection of files from ten years back was more of a testament to luck than any full-proof backup plan. However, we’ve never been content leaving this up to luck alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning, we have made deliberate decisions to ensure that work we create for our clients is systematically backed up and available for years to come. This is an overview of the redundant system we are using to keep all our files safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSystem Wide\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur backup plan starts with individual computers. This ensures everything on our systems is accessible at any given time. Should we experience a system malfunction, hard drive failure, theft or some other disaster, these backups are available to help us get up and running quickly. These system solutions work in tandem with the other services we outline to provide redundancy.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTime Machine\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe start with \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\"\u003eTime Machine\u003c/a\u003e, the built-in backup feature of OS X. This feature retains a copy of our of our files, as well as a feature that expresses how our system looked on any given day. These backups are synced via our wireless network and stored on two separate hard drives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBackblaze\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTime Machine is a terrific feature, but it is backing up the files to disks which reside at the same physical location as our computers. Thus, we require something that will allow us to backup the bulk of our files to remote storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lcrx.co/1vplTMd\"\u003eBackblaze\u003c/a\u003e excels. For $50 a year, Backblaze will continuously backup an unlimited amount of data from you computer and any drives attached to it. This provides us access to multiple versions of our files through its online interface. Or, we may request the shipment of a hard drive with all of our data on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this backup process is not a fast as a locally attached device or Time Machine running on our local network, Backblaze provides us with a sound piece of mind knowing that our files are continuously being backed up off-site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDesign Files\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe find it important to create an additional level of backup for our design files. Very often, these files can be quite large and a loss of the editable versions would require an inordinate amount of time to recreate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eLayerVault\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor many years, we stored all of our working design files on Dropbox so that we could access them from anywhere. We have since replaced this with one of my most relied-upon online services, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://layervault.com/r/3X2\"\u003eLayerVault\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLayerVault provides remote version control for all of our art files and a slew of other vital features. Years ago, we attempted to version-control our design files using Git, which resulted in oversized repositories. Thus, we were thrilled to discover that LayerVault offered this crucial service and provided file previews for each version. We no longer have to save versions of a file out as final-1, final-2, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to automatically versioning all of our design files, LayerVault allows us to share project files internally or with an external team. As a result, others involved in a project will always have access to the latest design files and assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, LayerVault retains all of our project files and allows us to leave and rejoin a project at any time. Thus, we are able to remove a folder of project files from our computer and rejoin the project at a later date. Doing so will, in turn, sync all of the design files for a project back to our computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eVault Drive\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an added layer of backup, I keep a large hard drive of every LaCroix Design Co. project connected to my computer. As projects are completed, they are organized in folders by year. Additionally, font files and other assets are regularly archived on this drive. Since the drive is attached to my system, it is also backed up using Backblaze. While I imagine that this drive may one day be replaced by \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\"\u003eAmazon Glacier\u003c/a\u003e or something similar, but this current setup has been working out very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDevelopment Files\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs our design process evolved from building static designs in traditional design applications to a process of iterating, prototyping and building interactive experiences with code, versioning and keeping backups of development files has become immensely important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eRepositories\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of our development projects are version-controlled using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://git-scm.com/\"\u003eGit\u003c/a\u003e. We host the majority of these repositories publicly and privately on \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e and utilize \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\"\u003eBitbucket\u003c/a\u003e to host repositories for our smaller projects that we wish to keep private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDocuments \u0026amp; Meeting Notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDocuments for all projects are stored on \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\"\u003eGoogle Drive\u003c/a\u003e and also archived along with all design files onto our Vault Drive upon the completion of each project. \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lcrx.co/1DylAxU\"\u003eEvernote\u003c/a\u003e is used to record all meeting notes, which are then shared internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf it is not obvious by now, our backup process is very important to us. Being able to provide files and assets years after a project is over allows us to continually exceed the expectations of the clients that partner with us.

When we are not behind our computers or sketching new ideas at our desks, you will most often find us enjoying craft beers, cocktails and/or a delicious meal somewhere that is most likely becoming our new favorite bar or restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can imagine our delight when we began talking with \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagofoodmagazine.com/\"\u003eChicago Food Magazine\u003c/a\u003e back in October. Their team had already begun documenting Chicago’s growing restaurant population through captivating photography.

Their goal was to create an online magazine that provides informative posts on the Chicago food scene in addition to breaking information on news and events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout our correspondence with Chicago Food Magazine, we brainstormed features and devised a plan for a publishing platform that would be able to meet their current goals while also providing a strong foundation for future developments. This platform provides the editorial team with tools to publish articles that include a variety of image and social media elements on the responsive website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur design process produced a scalable visual system that would highlight their rich use of photography and provide a pleasant reading experience for visitors. With a large social media following already in place, an important part of the website’s development involved creating a system for sharing content through those channels. To keep followers informed, breaking news is automatically dispersed across those outlets as articles are published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are thrilled to have had the opportunity to design and develop the new Chicago Food Magazine website. Even more so, we have thoroughly enjoyed the content that the magazine has been producing since launch. Over the next few weeks, we will be discussing the project in more detail through a series of blog posts as well as a case study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope that you take the opportunity to experience the new website at \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagofoodmagazine.com/\"\u003ewww.ChicagoFoodMagazine.com\u003c/a\u003e and hopefully we’ll catch you frequenting one of Chicago’s many top-notch establishments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/website-launch-chicago-food-magazine/website-launch-chicago-food-magazine-5777c0b5.jpg"},{"id":"/blog/one-year-of-node-bourbon/","title":"One Year of Node Bourbon","description":"Porting the Bourbon Sass library to focus on gulp.js, Grunt, and other Node.js-based build tools.","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/one-year-of-node-bourbon/","path":"/blog/one-year-of-node-bourbon/","published":"2014-09-11T12:30:00-05:00","updated":"2015-01-27T23:26:23-06:00","author":{"name":"Michael LaCroix","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/team/michael-lacroix/","path":"/team/michael-lacroix/","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/team/michael-lacroix-4e0cb6be.jpg"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eA year ago we released \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/lacroixdesign/node-bourbon\"\u003enode-bourbon\u003c/a\u003e, our port of \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thoughtbot.com/\"\u003ethoughtbot\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e excellent \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bourbon.io/\"\u003eBourbon\u003c/a\u003e library to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\"\u003enode-sass\u003c/a\u003e. Node-sass is a Node.js wrapper of \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://libsass.org/\"\u003eLibSass\u003c/a\u003e, an extremely fast version of Sass written in C/C++. The original version of Sass is written in Ruby which \u0026mdash; while a wonderful language \u0026mdash; can be a bit slow. With the forthcoming anniversary, we figured it was due time we wrote a blog post about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn case you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, Bourbon is a mixin library for \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\"\u003eSass\u003c/a\u003e, the popular CSS preprocessor.

The original Bourbon was being utilized in our projects for a couple years at that point, however we ran into compilation issues when trying to include it directly since LibSass does not have 100% feature compatibility with Ruby Sass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe decided to create a project which would include workarounds for those issues, while also providing some conveniences for Node.js-based build tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur primary goals for the project were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA focus on LibSass compatibility\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePackaged for npm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA convenience method for supplying the project path to both the build tool and to other libraries that might depend on it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow to use it\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll provide an example for using node-bourbon in a gulp.js project.
